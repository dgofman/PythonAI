1. Personal Web Page Generator
Write a program that asks the user for his or her name, then asks the user to enter a sentence that describes himself or herself. Here is an example of the programâ€™s screen:
Enter your name: Julie Taylor
Describe yourself: I am a computer science major, a member of the Jazz club, and I hope to work as a mobile app developer after I graduate.
Once the user has entered the requested input, the program should create an HTML file, containing the input, for a simple Web page. Here is an example of the HTML content.

>> python hw2_exercise5.py
Enter your name: Julie Taylor
Describe yourself: I am a computer science major, a member of the Jazz club, and I hope to work as a mobile app developer after I graduate.
