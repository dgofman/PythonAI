        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)\n",
        "\n",
        "In object-oriented programming (OOP), encapsulation refers to the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, or the restricting of direct access \n",
        "to some of an object's components. Encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing direct access to them \n",
        "by clients in a way that could expose hidden implementation details or violate state invariance maintained by the methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Why should an object’s data attributes be hidden from code outside the class?**\n",
        "\n",
        "https://programs.wiki/wiki/python_-private-properties-and-private-methods.html\n",
        "\n",
        "A private attribute and private method are defined in the parent class, which means that the private attribute and private method are the privacy of the parent class. \n",
        "Since it is the privacy of the parent class, we cannot access the privacy of the parent class outside the methods of the child class.\n",
        "In vernacular, private properties and private methods are the object's privacy, \n",
        "Since it is privacy, private attributes are attributes that do not want to be disclosed to the outside world.\n",

        "\n",
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance_(computer_science)\n",
        "\n",
        "In object-oriented programming (OOP), an instance is a concrete occurrence of any object, existing usually during the runtime of a computer program. \n",
        "Formally, \"instance\" is synonymous with \"object\" as they are each a particular value (realization), and these may be called an instance object; \"instance\" \n",
        "emphasizes the distinct identity of the object. The creation of an instance is called instantiation.\n",
        "\n",
        "In class-based programming, objects are created from classes by subroutines called constructors, and destroyed by destructors. \n",
        "An object is an instance of a class, and may be called a class instance or class object; instantiation is then also known as construction. \n",

        "“Private” instance variables that cannot be accessed except from inside an object don’t exist in Python. \n",
        "However, there is a convention that is followed by most Python code: a name prefixed with an underscore (e.g. _spam) should be treated as a non-public part of the API \n",
        "(whether it is a function, a method or a data member). It should be considered an implementation detail and subject to change without notice.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since there is a valid use-case for class-private members (namely to avoid name clashes of names with names defined by subclasses), there is limited support for such a mechanism, called name mangling.
